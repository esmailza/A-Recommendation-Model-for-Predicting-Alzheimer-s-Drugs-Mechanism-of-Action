# A Recommendation Model for Predicting Alzheimer's Drugs' Mechanism of Action
A simple binary prediction model that gets the Alzheimer's drugs' description texts as input. It classifies the drugs into two Small Molecules (SM) and Disease modifying therapies (DMT) categories. 

## Overview of encoding a document into a single CLS vector using BioBERT
